My career to this point has been an extremely rewarding journey. However, like all journeys, they can only continue with another step, and that step sometimes has to bring us to a new place.

My time at Optiv has been extremely rewarding, but opportunities must be seeked out lest we stagnate.
I therefore have come to the conclusion that it is time for me to move on. I bring this search public in the hope that it can ease some of the burden, as my network can help to spread this news for me.

My resume remains to be attached to this repository, so if any recruiters happen to see this, more information is available there.

For those of you that have been following along with my personal projects, I am sorry to not have an update today, but rest assured that more will come soon.
